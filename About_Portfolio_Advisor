AI-Powered Portfolio Manager is an all-in-one system that:

Tracks Your Portfolio in Real-Time

Pulls live prices and fundamental indicators for each stock or ETF in your portfolio.
Automatically calculates your total value, invested capital, and overall return.
Analyzes Market Sentiment, Technicals, and Macroeconomic Data

Gathers headlines from various sources, runs them through a sentiment-analysis pipeline, and produces an “overall market sentiment” gauge.
Computes technical indicators like RSI, MACD, SMA, and EMA for each ticker, and distills them into bullish, neutral, or bearish signals.
Aims for an 8% Monthly Return

Monitors your actual monthly performance against an 8% target. If you’re behind, it becomes more aggressive in recommending buys; if you’re ahead, it becomes more defensive.
Reinforces decision thresholds with performance-based logic so it can “catch up” if you’re lagging behind your monthly goal.
Generates Easy-to-Read Recommendations

Condenses its analysis into a neat recommendations table:
Which tickers to BUY (or expand your position in),
Which to HOLD (no action),
Which to SELL fully (and optionally re-position the freed capital into a more promising stock).
Rounds out a “step-by-step” Action Plan so you know exactly how to rebalance—no outside cash required.
Delivers Clean Email Reports

Automatically emails you with:
Real-time portfolio metrics,
Market summary,
Clearly labeled buy/sell signals,
A “Diagnostics” section that includes monthly performance vs. target, market sentiment gauge, and a bullet-point plan telling you exactly what trades to make.
Core Benefit: You get an autonomous, AI-driven investment adviser that seamlessly merges technical analysis, market news sentiment, and performance-targeted logic. It’s not just telling you broad signals—it’s providing a complete rebalancing roadmap that ensures your money is used efficiently within your own portfolio, targeting 8% monthly gains (or whatever threshold you choose).
